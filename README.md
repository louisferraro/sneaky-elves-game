# sneaky-elves-game
A 2d top-down game built with unity (C#)

Used prefabs to generate enemy entities within each level.

Wrote enemy AI to determine how smart the enemies were for each of the three levels. For Level 1, enemies will only chase you if you get in their vision cone. Level 2 enemies have abilities of Level 1 but will roam randomly in a predefined radius. Level 3 can has Level 2 AI but can also "hear" footsteps of closeby users.
